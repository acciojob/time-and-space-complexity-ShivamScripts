	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the amount of time it takes to run. It allows us to analyze the performance of an algorithm as the input size increases. An efficient algorithm is one that has a low time complexity and can handle large datasets with reasonable execution times.</p>

    <p>Space Complexity is a measure of how efficiently an algorithm uses memory space during its execution. It is often represented using the notation O(n), where 'n' is the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> focuses on the additional memory space used by an algorithm to solve a problem, and it's important to minimize unnecessary memory consumption in order to optimize an algorithm.</p>
